# Landing Page Project

This repository is for the Landing Page project for Front End Web Development Proffesional track by FWD and Udacity



I used the starter project found [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019).
I checked [W3 schools](http://w3schools.com/) and [Stackoverflow](stackoverflow.com) for some help.

This project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a static web page.
